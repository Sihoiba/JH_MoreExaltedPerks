# JH_MoreExaltedPerks
Adds several new exalted traits to add more variety to the experience (especially Inferno!). Whenever the game would apply an exalted trait, it includes the modded traits in the pool to pick from, whether spawning exalted packs, Nightmare respawns or Inferno!.

* ADAPTIVE - Gains damage resistance based on the last damage type taken, and a random damage type malus. 
* ALERTING - Former and Robot only. Increased health and makes a loud noise when it sees the player to attract other enemies. Also makes one enemy of the same class hunt the player.
* BAYONET - Formers only. Changes their normal ranged weapon based melee attack, to a 20 damage piercing melee attack.
* BLASTGUARD - Reduces splash damage by 75%
* BLINDING - Enemies inflict Dazzled status on attacks hit which reduces vision range. Melee attacks reduce vision range more than ranged attacks.
* CRITRESIST - Reduces incoming crit chance by 100%.
* DODGE - Formers only. Gains dodge on move like players.
* DRAINING - Drains player resource on hit
* EMPOWERED - Increases damage by 10% and speed by 5% every few turns, to +100% damage and +50% speed. Won't be combined with health increasing traits.

* SNIPER - Ranged attack enemies only. More damage, accuracy and defence the further from the player the creature is.
* SPIKY - Demon Only. Returns melee damage on hit.
* TAINTED - Non-Robot only. Enemies if not gibbed respawn as exalted a short time after death. Aka Nightmare mode on random enemies. Won't be used on N! or A! difficulty.
